= Configuring a DiskStore

{sdg-name} supports `DiskStore` configuration and creation through the `disk-store` element,
as the following example shows:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:disk-store id="Example" auto-compact="true" max-oplog-size="10"
                queue-size="50" time-interval="9999">
    <gfe:disk-dir location="/disk/location/one" max-size="20"/>
    <gfe:disk-dir location="/disk/location/two" max-size="20"/>
</gfe:disk-store>
----

`DiskStore` instances are used by Regions for file system persistent backup and overflow of evicted entries
as well as persistent backup for WAN Gateways. Multiple {data-store-name} components may share the same `DiskStore`.
Additionally, multiple file system directories may be defined for a single `DiskStore`, as shown in
the preceding example.

See {data-store-name}'s documentation for a complete explanation of
{x-data-store-docs}/developing/storing_data_on_disk/chapter_overview.html[Persistence and Overflow]
and configuration options on `DiskStore` instances.
