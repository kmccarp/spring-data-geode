= Preface

{sdg-name} focuses on integrating the Spring Framework's powerful, non-invasive programming model
and concepts with {data-store-name} to simplify configuration and development of Java applications
when using {data-store-name} as you data management solution.

This document assumes you already have a basic understanding of, and some familiarity with, the core Spring Framework
and {data-store-name} concepts.

While every effort has been made to ensure this documentation is comprehensive and complete without errors,
some topics are beyond the scope of this document and may require more explanation (for example, data distribution management
using partitioning with HA while still preserving consistency).  Additionally, some typographical errors might have crept in.
If you do spot mistakes or even more serious errors, please bring these issues to the attention of the Spring Data team
by raising an appropriate https://jira.spring.io/browse/SGF[issue in JIRA].
